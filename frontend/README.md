# Chat UI

A modern React chat application using Next.js that interacts with both standard and multi-agent chat completion API endpoints.

## Features

- Modern, visually appealing chat interface
- Two chat modes:
  - Standard chat (single agent)
  - Multi-agent chat (multiple specialized agents)
- Light and dark themes with custom color schemes
- Chat history management
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack

- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript
- Material UI components
- Lucide icons
- Atomic Design principles
- Storybook for component development

## Getting Started

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Development Setup](./docs/setup/development.md) guide.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chat-ui
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with the configuration variables (see [API Configuration](./docs/api/configuration.md))

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Architecture**
  - [Service Design](./docs/architecture/service-design.md)

## Architecture

The project follows the Atomic Design methodology:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, TextField, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Simple components made of atoms (ChatInput, MessageBubble)
- **Organisms**: More complex components (ChatHeader, ChatHistoryPanel)
- **Templates**: Page layouts (ChatPageLayout)
- **Pages**: Actual pages with data

## Services

Chat UI uses a service-based architecture:

- **IChatService**: Interface for chat API interactions
- **IHistoryService**: Interface for chat history management
- **MockChatService**: Mock implementation for development
- **LocalHistoryService**: In-memory history service for development

For production use, the mock services can be replaced with real API implementations without changing the application code. See the [Service Design](./docs/architecture/service-design.md) document for more details.

## Theme

The application supports both light and dark themes using custom color schemes. The theme can be toggled using the theme toggle in the chat header.
